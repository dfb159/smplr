# The SMPLR library
This is a library for all your analysis needs.
Made simple and accessible for everyday use.

## Feature overview
- automatic handling of uncertainties in every module
- importing from csv into numpy and pandas
- exporting single values, tables and functions in latex formatting
- fitting of measurement data to a given model function (with a bunch of predefined functions)
- plotting measurement data and plotting functions
- simulations and parameter tuning
- out-of-the-box NN training; not as powerful as tensorflow, but much faster to get started!
- probability propagation for discrete distributions

## Correspondence
This package was developed during my time at university.
It has a similar scope than [APN-Pucky's smpl library](https://github.com/APN-Pucky/smpl).
As you might have guessed, this is no coincidence as we have written most code on his repo together.
